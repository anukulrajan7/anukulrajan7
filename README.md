I am Anukul Raj, a BCA student with a strong passion for programming, web development, AI, and machine learning. I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and jQuery. Additionally, I am interested in staying up-to-date with the latest geopolitical events, finance-related developments, and startups.

I have created this Github profile to showcase my programming skills and share some of the projects that I have been working on. I am always eager to learn new things and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions.

Please take a look at my repositories to see some of my past work. If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting my profile!
